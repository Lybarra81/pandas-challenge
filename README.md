## "PyCity Schools Analysis" 
#In the analysis of PyCity Schools we looked at the school types in combination of their test scores and passing rates in math and reading. We also did #a comparison of the total school budget to the size of the school. Findings reguarding test scores led to two main conclusions:

#1. Charter schools demonstrated a higher passing rate and percentage of students passing in both math and reading comparing it to school districts. #Yet, thier reading scores are fairly similiar to the school districts. 

#2. Overall, smaller and medium-sized schools significantly did better than large size schools in terms os passing math performances.
